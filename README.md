<h2> Summary <h2/>
Credit risk analysis will help the company to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile . which controls loss of business to the company and avoid financial loss for the company.    
Credit risk analysis extends beyond credit analysis and is the process that achieves a lender’s goals by weighing the costs and benefits of taking on credit risk.

By balancing the costs and benefits of granting credit, lenders measure, analyze and manage risks their business is willing to accept.

The creditworthiness of the borrower, derived from the credit analysis process, is not the only risk lenders face. When granting credit, lenders also consider potential losses from non-performance, such as missed payments and potential bad debt. With such risks come costs, so lenders weigh them against anticipated benefits such as risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC).
